&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-what&quot;&gt;The what?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a Duckquill post example, this post has nothing but a bunch of text and random formatting, acting like a demo.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-info&quot;&gt;Some info&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, open this file and look at how it’s made, it includes all the essential front matter stuff.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to the &lt;em&gt;Stanley!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-stanley&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Stanley&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;!&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of a man named &lt;em&gt;Stanley&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stanley&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; worked for a company in a big building where he was Employee &lt;code&gt;#427&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bunnysocks.github.io&#x2F;resume&#x2F;index-ar&#x2F;the-office.webp&quot; alt=&quot;The Office&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The Office where Stanley works, it has yellow floor and beige walls&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employee &lt;code&gt;#427&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;’s job was simple: he sat at his desk in Room &lt;code&gt;427&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and he pushed buttons on a keyboard.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Employee &lt;code&gt;#427&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; did every day of every month of every year, and although others may have considered it soul rending,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stanley&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;Stanley&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was happy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then one day, something very peculiar happened.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that would forever change &lt;em&gt;Stanley&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something he would never quite forget.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he had realized not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one had shown up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say ‘hi’. Never in all his years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, &lt;em&gt;Stanley&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; found himself unable to move for the longest time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of his co-workers were gone. What could it mean? Stanley decided to go to the meeting room; perhaps he had simply missed a memo.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;The Office where Stanley works, it has yellow floor and beige walls&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employee &lt;code&gt;#427&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;’s job was simple: he sat at his desk in Room &lt;code&gt;427&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and he pushed buttons on a keyboard.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Employee &lt;code&gt;#427&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; did every day of every month of every year, and although others may have considered it soul rending,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stanley&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;Stanley&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was happy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then one day, something very peculiar happened.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that would forever change &lt;em&gt;Stanley&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something he would never quite forget.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he had realized not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one had shown up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say ‘hi’. Never in all his years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, &lt;em&gt;Stanley&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; found himself unable to move for the longest time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of his co-workers were gone. What could it mean? Stanley decided to go to the meeting room; perhaps he had simply missed a memo.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
